    <h1>What is a Croissant?</h1>
    <p>
      The word <em>croissant</em> in French means crescent, in the sense of
      “lunar crescent” and refers to the original shape of the bun. It is
      originally defined as a dough made from yeast, butter or margarine, but
      having spread worldwide, today it has countless adapted versions.
